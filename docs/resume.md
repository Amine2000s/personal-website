I build systems that do more than just CRUD.

My main focus is backend development using Java and Spring Boot. I care about the inner workings of the systems I write: performance, clarity, observability, and making sure they behave well under pressure.

I’ve also experimented with building mobile apps using Android/Java, and created small desktop utilities with JavaFX. But most of my time goes into architecting and delivering reliable backend services — with authentication, file uploads, rate limiting, and async logging baked in.



## 👨‍💻 Skills

- **Languages**: Java, Python, Bash, SQL
