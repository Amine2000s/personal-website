# My Experience with GSOC 2025



**Rejection…**

It’s something we all face at some point,especially in the world of software engineering.

Whether you’re applying for internships or jobs, proposing new features, or making important decisions,rejection can and will happen.

But here’s the thing: we shouldn’t let the feeling of rejection take over our decision-making or hold us back from trying again. Especially not in the middle of the journey, when things get tough and require even more time and effort.

Rejection doesn’t mean your effort was wasted. In fact, every experience—successful or not—comes with its own lessons and value.

For example, I was recently rejected from Google Summer of Code (GSoC), simply due to the limited number of slots available. At first, it was disappointing—but then I asked myself: does this mean I gained nothing? That all the time and effort I put in was for nothing?

Absolutely not. It was quite the opposite.

I gained so much throughout this experience,new knowledge, improved skills, and exposure to new 

- **Deep understanding of DICOM** (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and the architecture of modern medical imaging systems
- **Hands-on experience with real-world tools** like Kheops and Keycloak, building a tailored and extensible solution
- **Confidence navigating large codebases** and working with mature, production-grade open-source projects
- **Stronger technical writing and communication skills**, from drafting proposals to discussing implementation strategies with maintainers
- **Collaboration with project maintainers**, understanding their real needs, and iterating on a solution to meet them
- **Studied research papers** and analyzed complex components like Diomede and Niffler to better understand their design and integration
- **Contributed to the open-source community**, including helping newcomers understand the project and engage with its goals

So, if you're dealing with rejection right now, know this: you're still growing. You're still moving forward. And your effort s till counts.

Keep building. Keep learning. Keep showing up.

as i always say  “ Learn with curiosity , learn with enthusiasm “
