<p>Hello there.</p>

<p>
I'm a computer science enthusiast with a focus on <strong>Java and backend development</strong>, but i also explore <strong>other technologies</strong>, contribute to <strong>open source</strong>, and document what I learn along the way.

This site is where I document my journey through computer science and software engineering.

- 🛠️ Projects I’m building
- ✍️ Technical notes and tutorials
- 💡 Lessons from what I try, break, and learn
- 🎯 Thoughts and advice for those on a similar path


Whether you’re a fellow student, developer, or just curious, I hope you find something helpful or inspiring here.

### 💻 What I Do

I focus primarily on backend development—Java, Spring Boot, APIs, and systems work. I’ve also spent some time experimenting with mobile (Android) and desktop (JavaFX) development, AMost of what I build begins with a problem—something I need, or just can’t stop thinking about.
